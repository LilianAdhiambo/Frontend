<h1>DREAMS</h1>
<p>All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.
If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours.</p></div>

<h2>ATTITUDE</h2>
<P>Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.Choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how you're going to live your life.

Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation.Keep a good attitude and do the right thing even when it's hard. When you do that you are passing the test. And God promises you your marked moments are on their way.</P></div>

<h3>SUCCESS</h3>
 <p>The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.
      The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to to sucess.
      Success is to be meased not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome.
      A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him. </p></div>

 <h2>SELF BELIEF</h2>
  <p>I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles.
   Every moment and every event of every man's life on earth plants something in his soul.
   I value the friend who for me finds time on his calendar, but I cherish the friend who for me does not consult his calendar.

   In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.
  Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence.  Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.
