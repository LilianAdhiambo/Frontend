    <h1>IMPORTANCE OF DREAMS</h1>
    <p>All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="panel" id="blue">
    <p>If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours.</p>
