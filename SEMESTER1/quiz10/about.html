<h2>Biography of Lilian stratford</h2>
  <p>Lilian  has been trading the financial markets<br> privately on his own account for well over a decade.<br> As well as his extensive trading experience,<br> he also holds BSc Economics and Business Finance and <br>MSc Advanced Financial Economics degrees.<br>

He has operated in a range of markets and has <br>extensive knowledge of market bubbles, intermarket correlation,<br> asset pricing and portfolio hedging.<br>

A skilled day trader,  Lilian’s approach combines both <br>fundamental and technical analysis. His focus has shifted <br>over the years and today he more often favours medium<br> to long-term positions trading on stocks and intraday<br> swing trading on European and US markets.<br>

In addition to trading, Lilian has developed this website.<br> Originally all the information and tools you will find here were developed <br>for his own use by a dedicated research team. <br>However  Lilian  has now made this material available for fellow traders or <br>just those wishing to learn how to privately trade the financial markets.</p></div>
