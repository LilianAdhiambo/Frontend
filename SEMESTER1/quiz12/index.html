    <p>Babies don't need a vacation, but I still see them at the beach... it pisses me off! I'll go over to a little baby and say 'What are you doing here? You haven't worked a day in your life!'
      Isn't it funny how babies laugh a lot? I read a toddler, a young child laughs 300 times a day. The average adult laughs, like, four times a day. God put it in them. He put the laugh in us, but I think sometimes we let life get us down, you know, have bad breaks, and we lose our breaks.
      I kept my babies fed. I could have dumped them, but I didn't. I decided that whatever trip I was on, they were going with me. You're looking at a real daddy.

      If everyone took personal <span class="red"><a href="http:twitter.com" target="_blank">responsibility</a></span> for their animals, we wouldn't have a lot of the animal problems that we do. I'm a big spay-and-neuter supporter. Don't have babies if you're not going to take care of those babies. We don't need more. We just need to take care of the ones we have. Take responsibility and breathe kindness.
      I'm never as happy as when I'm pregnant. I literally would have 10 babies if I could!
      It is well for us that we are born babies in intellect. Could we understand half what <span class="blue"><a href="http:tumblr.com" target="-blank">mothers </a></span>say and do to their infants, we should be filled with a conceit of our own importance, which would render us insupportable through life.

      What good mothers and fathers <span class="blue"><a href="http://facebook.com" target="-blank">instinctively</a></span> feel like doing for their babies is usually best after all.

      Everyone knows that by far the happiest and universally enjoyable age of man is the first. What is there about babies which makes us hug and kiss and fondle them, so that even an enemy would give them help at that age?  
      Nothing more strongly arouses our disgust than cannibalism, yet we make the same impression on Buddhists and vegetarians, for we feed on babies, though not our own.
      Promises are like crying babies in a theater, they should be carried out at once.
      Babies don't need fathers, but mothers do. Someone who is taking care of a baby needs to be taken care of.

      We all parent the best we can. Being human, we're ambivalent. We want perfection for our babies, but we also need sleep.The more people have studied different methods of bringing up children the more they have come to the conclusion that what good mothers and fathers instinctively feel like doing for their babies is the best after all.
The body is ready to have babies. Nature wants it done then, when the body can handle it, not after 40, when the income can handle it.
My singing is really important to me, but when children come along they'll be my main focus. I'd never put my career in front of my babies - it'd be a case of fitting jobs around them.
I've helped launch 49 careers - those that have been in PiL. To me, they are my babies; whatever they get up to, they know I love them. They've been living in my pockets, and they should show more gratitude.
	Sometimes I daydream about having a farm and a wife and some babies and watching the grass grow, but you have to meet the right person for that.
    Licences to have babies incidentally is something that I got in trouble for some years ago for suggesting even in Canada that this might be necessary at some point, at least some restriction on the right to have a child.	</p>

    <p>There's a way of playing safe, there's a way of<br> using tricks and there's the way I like to<br>  play which is dangerously where you're<br>  going to take a chance on making mistakes in order to <br> create something you haven't created before.<br> The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very<br>  natural and common thing; and when men succeed in this they <br> are always praised rather than condemned.<br>  But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire<br>  more at all costs, they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.<br> 

    You can live your life angry, bitter, mad at somebody <br> or even guilty, not letting go of your own mistakes,<br>  but you won't receive the good <br>  things God has in store.America makes  <br> prodigious mistakes, America has colossal faults, <br>  but one thing cannot be denied: America <br>  is always on the move. She may be going to Hell, <br>  of course, but at least she isn't standing still. <br> It is not because the truth is too difficult <br>  to see that we make mistakes... we make mistakes  <br> because the easiest and most comfortable <br>  course for us is to seek insight where it accords with <br>  our emotions - especially selfish ones.To make no  <br> mistakes is not in the power of man; <br>  but from their errors and mistakes the wise and good <br>  learn wisdom for the future. <br>

  Mistakes can be corrected by those who pay <br>  attention to facts but dogmatism will not be corrected by <br>  those who are wedded to a vision. <br> Of course I make mistakes. I'm human. If I didn't <br>  make mistakes,I'd never learn. You can <br>  only go forward by making mistakes. <br>

<p id="content_1">
  <p1>The truth is, I'm proud of the life I've lived <br>so far, and though I've made my share of mistakes,<br> I have no regrets.Take chances,<br> make mistakes. That's how you grow.<br> Pain nourishes your courage. You have to fail in order <br>to practice being brave.<br>
It is not our mistakes that define who we are;<br> it is how we recover from those mistakes.<br>

Success seems to be connected with action. Successful<br> people keep moving.They make mistakes, <br>but they don't quit.
No man chooses<br> evil because it is evil; he only mistakes <br>It for happiness, the good he seeks.<br>
Dodging and burning are steps to take care of<br> mistakes God made in establishing tonal relationships.<br>

Mistakes are a part of being human. Appreciate <br>your mistakes for what they are: precious life lessons<br> that can only be learned the hard way.<br> Unless it's a fatal mistake, which, at least,<br> others can learn from.Failure is a great teacher,<br> and I think when you make mistakes<br> and you recover from them and you treat them as valuable learning <br>experiences, then you've got something to <br>share.
I firmly believe that you live and learn,<br> and if you don't learn from past mistakes, then you<br> need to be drug out and shot.<br>
<img src="../../../Desktop/pics/lol.jpg " alt="lol.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px;" height="130" width="130">

  After all these years, I am still involved in the<br> process of self-discovery. It's better to explore <br>life and make mistakes than to play <br>it safe. Mistakes are part of the dues one<br> pays for a full life.<br>
I wouldn't change anything. I've made mistakes, <br>but thanks to those mistakes, I've learned.<br>
Do not brood over your past mistakes and failures as this<br> will only fill your mind with grief, regret<br> and depression. Do not repeat<br> them in the future.<br>
A man of genius makes no mistakes; his errors are<br> volitional and are the portals of discovery.<br>Intelligence is not to make no mistakes,<br> but quickly to see how to make them good.<br>
