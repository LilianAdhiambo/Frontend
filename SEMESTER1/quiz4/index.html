  <h2> TIPS TO SUCCESS</h2>

    <p>The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.
      The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to to sucess.
      Success is to be meased not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome.
      A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him. </p>

    <h4>WHO I AM</h4><hr>
    <p>I believe in pink. I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner. I believe in kissing, kissing a lot. I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles.
   Every moment and every event of every man's life on earth plants something in his soul.
   I value the friend who for me finds time on his calendar, but I cherish the friend who for me does not consult his calendar.
   In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.
  Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence.  Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.
