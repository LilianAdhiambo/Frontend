					<p>Sam Richmond’s mates all have exciting plans for the holidays. When Sam has to confess his own plans—going to visit his grandmother—his mates think it’s a great joke, and Sam is convinced he’s going to be bored out of his brain. But things turn out quite differently. For a start, there’s his mad-genius uncle, and there are mysteries to be solved: things that are missing, relationships that are fractured, and that other question that’s always at the back of Sam’s mind—how on earth do you talk to girls without going red, stammering, saying something stupid or doing all those things at once?
					The year is 2199. As his city descends into war, sixteen-year-old Nik dreams of being chosen for the Intelligence Services—it’s either that or be conscripted to fight Breken hostiles over the river on Southside. He doesn’t know that the military has other plans for him. When his school is bombed and his young friend, Sol, is kidnapped by hostiles, </p>

					<p>After weeks of reading, discussing and reading some more, we have chosen a shortlist of five contenders for the 2010 Text Prize for Young Adult and Children’s Writing. We were really impressed with the high standard of entries this year, and look forward to the continued growth of the prize, now in its third year.

					Haunting the Dead, Tiffany Chapple
					The Diamond Factory, Julie Harris-Spearritt
					Breken Crossing, Jane Higgins
					Youth Bytes, Stephen Turner
					How to Talk to Girls, Philippa Werry

					Congratulations to each of these authors! The winner will be announced at the Australian Booksellers' Association Conference in Brisbane on July 12, and on the Text website later that day. The winning book will be published by Text in mid-2011.</p>
