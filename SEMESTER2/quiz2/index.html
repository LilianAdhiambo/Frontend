		<p>He who finds a wife then finds a good thing and  therefore receives favor from God...<br>this is evident in the faces of this brothers ...
		Many a man claims to have unfailing love, <br>but a faithful man who can find?  The righteous man leads a blameless life; <br>blessed are his children after him.<br>(proverbs 20:6-7)<br>

		"Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and <br>female,'  and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <br>and the two will become one flesh' ?  So they are no longer two, but one. <br>Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."<br>(mathew 19:4-6)<br>
		Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, <br>for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.<br>  Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have,because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."  So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?"  Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith..<br>(Hebrews 13:4-7)<br>

		<h1>To the newly weds</h1>
		<p id="pano">Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.  Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.  Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her  to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,  and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.  In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.  After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--  for we are members of his body.  "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."  This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.  However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
		Let him who have ears hear..Ephesians 5:22-33</p>
