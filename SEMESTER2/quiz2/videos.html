		<p>First things first: Don’t be fooled by Kansiime Anne.  Her impish smile betrays an astute businesswoman and theatrical powerhouse that has managed to export Ugandan comedy around the world as viral skits that have garnered thousands of views. This writer, producer, stand-up comic and performer will leave you in stitches: holding your sides, wiping your eyes, and asking for more.  And because her doses are as bite-size as her petite, stylish frame, you can probably fit more belly laughs in your work day than action points and still leave your nine to five feeling like a success.

A Mukiga woman from the deep rolling hills of Kabale in Western Uganda, ‘Kansiime Anne’ as she presents herself spotlights everything from university strikes to parenting, dating to marriage, Valentines Day and being a co-wife;  she is a crazy mechanic, safety-obsessed ‘boda-boda’ (motorbike-taxi driver), a jealous girlfriend practicing ‘kunga-fua’ and sleepy student with ingenious ways of ducking phone calls among the many characters she takes on with bodacious humor.

Unscripted and often weaving in and out of Luganda, Acholi and Buchiga (languages of central, northern and southern Uganda respectively), she <p id="para">presents her locality within a universal context. Like all talented comedians before her with a good understanding of their role in a healthy society, she speaks to underlying social issues – migration of the rural poor to the cities, con-men and uneducated politicians – within a lighthearted context that gets you thinking without realizing it.  Some of her skits are pointed: the lazy university student who starts a strike to avoid a paper she did not prepare or as a future wedding guest expecting to contribute straws who, after eyeing the lavish line items of the less-than-wealthy couple’s ceremony, retracts her own invitation with a, “Its ok, don’t invite me. I’ll just pray for you”.  In a society where student strikes and extravagant nuptials are common, these will ring a bell and strike a chord (not always comfortable) for those in the know.
Anne Kansiime is a talented  award winning comedian, Actress and writer in fun factory.

She is a graduate of Social Sciences from Makerere University, an old girl of Kabale primary school and Bweranyangi Girls in Bushenyi. She is also a very proud Mukiga from Mparo, Kabale.
It is a cool Thursday morning, but in Ann Kansiime’s world, it is just the perfect day to pay homage to all, or at least most, of the colours of the rainbow. I must add it is all a very tasteful affair completed with a black jacket and black boots.
